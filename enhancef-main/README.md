# 🚀 Elevate — AI Placement Readiness Simulator

Elevate is an AI-powered holistic skill development platform designed to simulate real placement readiness for students.
The system integrates **coding practice, aptitude testing, and AI mock interviews** into a unified dashboard that evaluates performance, identifies skill gaps, and provides personalized improvement guidance.

This project was developed as a hackathon prototype focusing on **clean architecture, working features, and demonstrable impact** rather than production-level scale.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students preparing for placements typically use multiple disconnected platforms for coding, aptitude, and communication skills.
This fragmented preparation makes it difficult to assess overall readiness and identify weaknesses effectively.

Elevate solves this by providing a **single AI-driven readiness simulator** that evaluates all core placement skills together.
